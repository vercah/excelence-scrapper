Excellence was a Czech governmental project unifying many competitions and olympiads in the Czech Republic. Unfortunately it isn't working anymore.

This program was written to use its public database (http://excelence.msmt.cz/homepage/table) and download names of students and their schools given the name of the desired competition.

Uses Python and geckodriver to browse web, BeautifulSoup to process html.
